# Project 1: Basic Calculator

## Overview

This is a basic calculator program written in C. It is designed using the do while loop and switch to perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to enter two operands and an operator, then displays the calculation result.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- User-friendly interactive command-line interface.
- Basic error handling for division by zero.

## Limitations

- The program handles only two operands at a time.
- It does not support complex mathematical operations or parentheses.
- The program assumes valid input format and does not have advanced error handling for invalid inputs.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. You can compile the program using the GCC.
